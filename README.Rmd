The aim of the package `chessboard` is to provide functions to work with **directed**
(asymmetric) and **undirected** (symmetrical) spatial **networks**.
It makes easier the creation of **connectivity matrix**, i.e. a binary matrix 
of dimensions `n x n`, where `n` is the number of **nodes** (sampling units) 
indicating the presence (`1`) or the absence (`0`) of an **edge** (link) 
between pairs of nodes. Different network objects can be produced by `chessboard`:

- **nodes list**
- **neighbors list**
- **edges list**
- **connectivity matrix**



In addition, the package can also produce objects that can be used later in 
Asymetric Eigenvector Maps (AEM, Blanchet _et al._ 2008), method available in 
the package [`adespatial`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=adespatial) (Dray _et al._ 2022):
**nodes by edges matrix** and **edges weights vector**.

<br/>

This package has been developed for the 
[FRB-CESAB](https://www.fondationbiodiversite.fr/en/about-the-foundation/le-cesab/) 
working group 
[Bridge](https://www.fondationbiodiversite.fr/en/the-frb-in-action/programs-and-projects/le-cesab/bridge/) 
that aims to better understand the role of local and regional environmental 
factors in shaping the taxonomic and functional diversity of plant communities 
established along river corridors, roadside corridors and cultivated field 
margins.



## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("frbcesab/chessboard")
```

Then you can attach the package `chessboard`:

```{r eval = FALSE}
library("chessboard")
```



## Get started

Please read the [Get started](https://frbcesab.github.io/chessboard/articles/chessboard.html)
vignette.
