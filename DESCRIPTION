Description: Provides functions to work with directed (asymmetric) and 
    undirected (symmetrical) spatial networks. It makes easier the creation of 
    connectivity matrix, i.e. a binary matrix of dimensions n x n, where n is 
    the number of nodes (sampling units) indicating the presence (1) or the 
    absence (0) of an edge (link) between pairs of nodes. Different network 
    objects can be produced by chessboard: node list, neighbor list, edge 
    list, connectivity matrix.
