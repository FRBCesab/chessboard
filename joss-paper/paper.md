# Summary

Lorem ipsum \autoref{fig:fig1}.

![Overview of methods available in `chessboard` to detect neighbors. Red dots locate the node of interest (5-5) and black dots correspond to detected neighbors. Each column corresponds to a specific method derived from the chess game. Each row illustrates the use of one argument (row 1: default settings; row 2: use of the argument `degree`; row 3: use of the argument `directed`; row 4: use of the argument `reverse`)\label{fig:fig1}](figures/ms-fig-1.png){ width=100% }
