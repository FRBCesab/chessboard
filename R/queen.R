#' Find neighbors according to queen movement
#' 
#' @description
#' For one node (argument `focus`), finds neighbors among a list of nodes 
#' according to the queen movement.
#' This movement is derived from the chess game. The queen is a combination of
#' the [bishop()] and the [rook()] and can find neighbors horizontally, 
#' vertically, and diagonally.
#' 
#' The detection of neighbors using this method can only work with 
#' two-dimensional sampling (both **transects** and **quadrats**). 
#' For sampling of type **transects-only** or **quadrats-only**, 
#' please use the functions [fool()] or [pawn()], respectively.
