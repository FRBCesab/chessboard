\title{Find edges between nodes based on a degree of neighborhood}
\usage{
edges_list(nodes, degree = 1, self = FALSE, all = FALSE, directed = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{nodes}{a \code{character} vector of nodes (sites) labels.}

\item{degree}{an \code{integer} of length 1. The number of neighbors used to
define edges.}

\item{self}{a \code{logical} of length 1. If \code{TRUE}, a node can be linked to
itself. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{all}{a \code{logical} of length 1. If \code{TRUE}, the missing edges are also
returned. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{directed}{a \code{logical} of length 1. If \code{FALSE} (default), symmetrical
edges (e.g. S01-S02 and S02-S01) are returned. Otherwise only the first
edge (e.g. S01-S02) is returned (according to direction of the nodes
labels).}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} with three columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{from}: label of one of the two nodes of the edge
\item \code{to}: label of the other node of the edge
\item \code{edge}: 0 (no edge) or 1 (edge)
}
}
\description{
Finds edges (links) between nodes (sites) based on a degree of neighborhood.
The nodes labels (argument \code{nodes}) will be ordered to find edges in a
directional way (from upstream to downstream along a linear shape).

Note that the detection of edges is only based on the nodes labels
(no explicit spatial detection). For instance, if nodes are labelled as
\strong{S-01}, \strong{S-02}, ..., \strong{S-10}, the most upstream site will be \strong{S-01}
and the most downstream \strong{S-10}.

With a degree of neighborhood of 1, a node will be linked to the first
previous node and also to the first next node (undirected network). So,
two edges will be detected. If \code{directed = FALSE}, this node will be only
linked to first next node (directed network).
