\usage{
bishop_left(
  nodes,
  focus,
  degree = 1,
  directed = FALSE,
  reverse = FALSE,
  self = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{nodes}{a \code{data.frame} with the following three columns:
\code{node}, \code{transect}, and \code{quadrats}. See \code{\link[=create_nodes_labels]{create_nodes_labels()}} for
further information.}

\item{focus}{an \code{character} of length 1. The node label for which the
neighbors must be found. Must exist in the \code{nodes} object.}

\item{degree}{an \code{integer} of length 1. The maximum number of neighbors to
search for in one direction.}

\item{directed}{a \code{logical} of length 1. If \code{FALSE} (default), search for
neighbors in all directions (undirected network). Otherwise, the network
will be considered as directed according the main direction of the system
(i.e. through quadrats).}

\item{reverse}{a \code{logical} of length 1. If \code{TRUE}, change the orientation of
the network (i.e. through quadrats). This argument is ignored if
\code{directed = FALSE}.}

\item{self}{a \code{logical} of length 1. If \code{TRUE}, a node can be its own
neighbor. Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A subset of the \code{nodes} (\code{data.frame}) where each row is a neighbor
of \code{focus}.
}
\description{
For one node (argument \code{focus}), finds neighbors among a list of nodes
according to the bishop left movement.
This movement is derived from the \code{\link[=bishop]{bishop()}} piece. The bishop left
can move along the bottom-right to top-left diagonal in both orientations
(default behavior).

\strong{Important:} Use the function \code{\link[=create_nodes_labels]{create_nodes_labels()}} to create nodes
labels.

The detection of neighbors using the bishop left method can only work with
two-dimensional sampling (both \strong{transects} and \strong{quadrats}) and
one-dimensional sampling of type \strong{quadrats}. For sampling of type
\strong{transects} or \strong{quadrats}, please use the functions \code{\link[=fool]{fool()}} or
\code{\link[=pawn]{pawn()}}, respectively.

The identification of neighbors is only based on the nodes labels (no
explicit spatial detection). This means that labeling nodes is a
\strong{crucial step}.

The argument \code{degree} controls for the degree of neighborhood.
If \code{degree = 2}, four neighbors will be identified (except if
\code{directed = TRUE}): four nodes along the bottom-right to top-left diagonal.

If \code{directed = TRUE} and \code{reverse = FALSE}, only two nodes will be
considered as neighbors (remove the nodes at the bottom of the focus node).

If \code{directed = TRUE} and \code{reverse = TRUE}, only two nodes will be
considered as neighbors (remove the nodes at the top of the focus node).
}
\note{
This function is called by \code{\link[=edges_list]{edges_list()}} (if \code{type = "rook"}). It can be
directly used only to 1) understand the neighbors detection method, 2) to
check, and 3) visualize detected neighbors for one particular node.
